# Welcome to the CAP SFLIGHT App

This is a sample app for the travel reference scenario, built with the [SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP)](https://cap.cloud.sap) and [SAP Fiori Elements](https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/smart-templates).

The purpose of this sample app is to:
* Demonstrate SAP Fiori annotations
* Demonstrate and compare SAP Fiori features on various stacks (CAP Node.js, CAP Java SDK, ABAP)
* Run UI test suites on various stacks

![Process Travels Page](img.png)

Currently the app is only available for the CAP Node.js stack. A version for CAP Java SDK will follow soon.

The app still contains some workarounds that are going to be addressed over time.
In some cases, the model and the handlers can be improved or simplified once further planned CAP features become available.
In other cases, the app itself could be improved. For example, calculation of the total price for a travel
currently simply sums up the single prices ignoring the currencies.

## SAP Fiori UI with Node.js Backend

### Build and Run

1. In a console, execute `npm ci` in the root folder of your project.
2. In a console, execute `cds watch` in the root folder of your project.

### Accessing the SAP Fiori App

Open this link in your browser:
http://localhost:4004/travel_processor/webapp/index.html

### Integration Tests

To start OPA tests, open this link in your browser:
http://localhost:4004/travel_processor/webapp/test/integration/opaTests.qunit.html

Test documentation is available at:
https://ui5.sap.com/#/api/sap.fe.test

## SAP Fiori UI with Java Backend

### Build and Run

1. In a console, execute `npm ci` in the root folder of your project.
2. In a console, execute `mvn spring-boot:run` in the root folder of your project.
3. In another console, execute `npm start` in folder `app\travel_processor` of your project (this starts the middleware)

Note: If you access the CAP Java server directly without middleware, you will have to enter mock user credentials admin / admin which are maintained in file application.yml.

## Deployment to SAP Business Technology Platform

The project contains a configuration for deploying the CAP services (with Node.js backend) and the SAP Fiori app to the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) using a managed application router. The app then becomes visible in the content manager of the SAP Launchpad service.

### Prerequisites
#### SAP Business Technology Platform

- Create a [trial account on SAP BTP](https://www.sap.com/products/business-technology-platform/trial.html). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html) for more information. Alternatively, you can use a sub-account in a productive environment.
- Subscribe to the [SAP Launchpad Service](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-portal-cloud-foundry-getting-started.html).
- Create an [SAP HANA Cloud Service instance](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-app-hana-cloud-setup.html#08480ec0-ac70-4d47-a759-dc5cb0eb1d58) or use an existing one.
  
#### Local Machine

- Install the Cloud Foundry command line interface (CLI). See this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-cf-download-cli.html) for more details.
- Install the [MultiApps CF CLI Plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin):

  ```shell
  cf add-plugin-repo CF-Community https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org
  cf install-plugin multiapps
  ```

- Install the [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-mta-build-tool) globally:

  ```shell
  npm install -g mbt
   ```

### Build the Project

Build the project from the command line:

```shell
mbt build
```

The build results will be stored in the directory `mta_archives`.

### Deploy

1. Log in to the target space.
2. Deploy the MTA archive using the CF CLI: `cf deploy mta_archives/capire.sflight_1.0.0.mtar`

### Assign Role Collection

In the SAP BTP Cockpit, assign the role collection `admin-{spacename}` to your user.
